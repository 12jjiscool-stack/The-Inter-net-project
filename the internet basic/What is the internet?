the internet is a global computer network providing a variety of information and communication facilities, consisting of interconnected networks using standardized communication protocols.
if your wondering, yes this is completly A.I which may seem horrible BUT it is true, The internet is not all that it seems.
(this is all in my words and my knowledge) 
the internet is not all sunshine and rainbows. 
there is another side of the internet called the DarkNet, What is the Darknet? you may ask
the darknet is a place for many crypto currencys,Illigal items (drugs etc.) and even other VERY illigal things
such as "fake" id's or other things such as "Hitman jobs" now how would i know all of this? i grew up with a certain app called youtube and have even been in darknet myself (i did nothing illigal)
There is only 1 way to acsess the darknet, and to accses it safely go to Internet Extreme folder in the main respitory.
Thank you for Reading this +1 internet knowledge :)
