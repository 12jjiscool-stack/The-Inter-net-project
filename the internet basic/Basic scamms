Has your grandma or even you gotten scammed?
well here are some basic methods scammers use (most popular - not all will be in here)

1. Email scam tactics
some emails you get will tell you about a chance to win "Big money"
or say it will give you "free coupons" and or gift cards.
by clicking this email and whatever button you hit to go to the "offer"
it will commonly lead you to 1 of 2 things.
1. a ad blocker install popup (its a virus most of the time or a redirect to an not sfw site)
2. a site that will popup and say hit the gift or sm and make you put in your credit card info (pretty common)
this is easy to avoid! js make a new email and avoid sketchy sites, becuase they can track your email or email you when you sign up for a website.
perfect example is Quora.

2. phone calls 
this is where the funny videos of scammer payback (an ethical hacker) trolls scammers
scammers will look at data breaches that have Your personal info like name and number etc. 
OR stolen mail,calling random numbers and social engenering tactics like making websites that ask for a phone numbers for example.
most of the time they will call you and say that they are your "bank" and there was a "un-verified use of one of your cards" this gets alot of seniors every year.
about 147,000 older folks reported getting scammed in 2024.
then they will have you enter your credit card info to "recover your money or to verify that it is you"
The scammer are sometimes violent and get irratated easly if you mess with them.
how to stop this? tell the to stop or you will call the police and maybe say you have tracked them. (scare them a little bit)
or change phone numbers.
